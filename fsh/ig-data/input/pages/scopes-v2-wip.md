## Draft API Additions for SMART Scopes v2 (work in progress)

This documentation captures API design plans as of August 2020, as a target for the Granular Data track at the FHIR September 2020 Connectathon.

### Finer-grained interaction constraints using `.cruds`

In SMART 1.0, scopes ended in `.read`, `.write`, or `.*`. For SMART 2.0, we provide more detailed suffixes to convey support for the following FHIR REST API interactions:

* `c` for `create`
  * Type level [create](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#create)
* `r` for `read`
  * Instance level [read](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#read)
  * Instance level [vread](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#vread)
  * Instance level [history](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history)
* `u` for `update`
  * Instance level [update](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#update)
    Note that some servers allow for an [update operation to create a new instance](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#upsert)
  * Instance level [patch](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#patch)
* `d` for `delete`
  * Instance level [delete](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#delete)
* `s` for `search`
  * Type level [search](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#search)
  * Type level [history](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history)
  * System level [search](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#search)
  * System level [history](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history)

Valid suffixes are a subset of the in-order string `.cruds`. For example, to convey support for creating and updating observations, use scope `patient/Observation.cu`. To convey support for reading and searching observations, use scope `patient/Observation.rs`. For backwards compatibility, servers SHOULD advertise the `permission-v1` capability in their `.well-known/smart-configuration` discovery document, SHOULD return v1 scopes when v1 scopes are requested and granted, and SHOULD process v1 scopes with the following semantics in v2:

* v1 `.read` ⇒ v2 `.rs`
* v1 `.write` ⇒ v2 `.cud`
* v1 `.*` ⇒ v2 `.cruds`

Scope requests with undefined or out of order interactions MAY be ignored, replaced with server default scopes, or rejected. For example, a request of `.dus` is not a defined scope request. This policy is to prevent misinterpretation of scopes with other conventions (e.g., interpreting `.read` as `.rd` and granting extraneous delete permissions).

### Batches and Transactions

SMART 2.0 does not define specific scopes for [batch or transaction](http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#transaction) interactions. These system-level interactions are simply convience wrappers for other interactions. As such, batch and transaction requests should be validated based on the actual requests within them.

### Scope Equivalence

Multiple scopes compounded or expanded are equivalent to each other.  E.g., `Observation.rs` is interchangeable with `Observation.r Observation.s`. In order to reduce token size, it is recomended that scopes be factored to their shortest form.

### Finer-grained resource constraints using search parameters

In SMART 1.0, scopes were based entirely on FHIR Resource types, as in `patient/Observation.read` (for Observations) or `patient.Immunization.read` (for Immunizations). In SMART 2.0, we provide more detailed constraints based on FHIR REST API search parameter syntax. To apply these constraints, add a query string suffix to existing scopes, starting with `?` and followed by a series of `param=value` items separated by `&`. For example, to request read and search access to laboratory observations but not other observations, the scope `patient/Observation.rs?category=laboratory`.

### Requirements for support

While the search parameter based syntax here is quite general, and could be used for any search parameter defined in FHIR, we're seeking community consensus on a small common core of search parameters for broad support. Initially, servers supporting SMART v2 scopes SHALL support:

* `category=` constraints for any supported resource types where `category` is a defined search parameter. This includes support for category-based Observation access on any server that supports Observation access.

### Experimental features

Because the search parameter based syntax here is quite general, it opens up the possibility of using many features that servers may have trouble supporting in a consistent and performant fashion. Given the current level of implementation experience, the following features should be considered experimental, even if they are supported by a server:

* Use of search modifiers such as `Observation.rs?code:in=http://valueset.example.org/ValueSet/diabetes-codes`
* Use of search parameter chaining such as `Observation.rs?patient.birthdate=1990`
* Use of FHIR's `_filter` capabilities


### Scope size over the wire

Scope strings appear over the wire at several points in an OAuth flow. Implementers should be aware that fine-grained controls can lead to a proliferation of scopes, increasing in the length of the `scope` string for app authorizations. As such, implementers should take care to avoid putting arbitrarily large scope strings in places where they might not "fit". The following considerations apply, presented in the sequential order of a SMART App Launch:

* When initiating an authorization request, app developers should prefer POST-based authorization requests to GET-based requests, since this avoid URL length limits that might apply to GET-based authorization requests. (For example, somme current-generation browsers have a 32kB length limit for values displayed in the URL bar.)
* In the authorization code redirect response, no scopes are included, so these considerations do not apply.
* In the access token response, no specific limits apply, since this payload comes in response to a client-initiated POST.
* In the token introspection response, no specific limits apply, since this payload comes in response to a client-initiated POST.
* In the access token itself, implementation-specific considerations may apply. SMART leaves access token formats out of scope, so formally there are no restrictions. But since access tokens are included in HTTP headers, servers should take care to ensure they do not get too large. For example, some current-generation HTTP servers have an 8kB limit on header length. To remain under this limit, authorization servers that use structured token formats like JWT might consider embedding handles or pointers to scopes, rather than embedding literal scopes in an access token. Alternatively, authorization servers might establish an internal convention mapping shorter scope names into longer scopes (or common combinations of longer scopes).
