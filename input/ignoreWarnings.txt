# The 'no narrative' parameter is used for these resources instances because they are infrastructural in nature and used in strictly managed trading systems where all systems share a common data model and additional text is unnecessary.

# smart-codes is exempt from THO Process, see details at https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/2024-03-18+TSMG+Agenda+and+Minutes
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/smart-codes: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
