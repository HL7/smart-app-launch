  "description": "Profile on Organization to convey a User Access Brand.\n\nFor background and context, see **[User Access Brands Overview](brands.html#brand-profile-organization)**.\n\nIn addition to the core data elements on Organization, two key extensions are used in this profile:\n\n* <http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/organization-brand> conveys the organization's logo(s) and other top-level branding details. See definitions for details.\n* <http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/organization-portal> conveys the details of a user portal and its associated FHIR endpoints. See definitions for details.\n\n Notes:\n* `0..1 MS` `partOf` Conveys that an affiliate Brand response for providing this Brand's user access. The hierarchy of \"access provided by\" links SHALL NOT exceed a depth of two (i.e., a Brand either includes portal details or links directly to a Brand that provides them).\n\n* `0..* MS` `identifier` Conveys identifiers that apps can use to link this Brand across publishers or with external data sets. EHRs SHALL support customer-supplied identifiers (`system` and `value`).\n\n    * It is RECOMMENDED that each Brand include an identifier where `system` is `urn:ietf:rfc: 3986` (meaning the identifier is a URL) and `value` is the HTTPS URL for the Brand's primary web presence, omitting any \"www.\" prefix from the domain and omitting any path component. For example, since the main web presence of Boston Children's Hospital is https://www.childrenshospital.org/, a recommended identifier would be:     `{\"system\": \"urn:ietf:rfc:3986\",\"value\": \"https://childrenshospital.org\"}`",
