Logo should be be legible at small sizes (e.g., as small as 50x50 pixels). Tips to achieve this: if the logo contains both a brandmark and a wordmark, separate them and use just the brandmark. If the logo is predominantly horizontal, consider creating a vertically-oriented logo that is still recognizable when scaled to smaller sizes. Multiple logos may be supplied.
